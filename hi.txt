describing the galaxys appearance from earth a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars in other arms of the galaxy, which are so far away that they cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye . the milky way is a barred spiral galaxy with a d 25 isophotal diameter estimated at 26.8±1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400±3,600 lightyears ), 10 but only about 1,000 lightyears thick at the spiral arms (more at the bulge). recent simulations suggest that a dark matter area, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million lightyears (613 kpc). 26 27 the milky way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the local group of galaxies, forming part of the virgo supercluster which is itself a component of the laniakea supercluster . 28 29 it is estimated to contain 100400 billion stars 30 31 and at least that number of planets . 32 33 the solar system is located at a radius of about 27,000 lightyears (8.3 kpc) from the galactic center , 34 on the inner edge of the orion arm , one of the spiralshaped concentrations of gas and dust. the stars in the innermost 10,000 lightyears form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. the galactic center is an intense radio source known as sagittarius a , a supermassive black hole of 4.100 (± 0.034) million solar masses . 35 36 the oldest stars in the milky way are nearly as old as the universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the dark ages of the big bang . 37 galileo galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the milky way contained all the stars in the universe . 38 following the 1920 great debate between the astronomers harlow shapley and heber doust curtis , 39 observations by edwin hubble in 1923 showed that the milky way is just one of many galaxies. retrieved from httpsen.wikipedia.orgwindex.phptitlemilkywayoldid1276830519
